{"name":"CIRCOS PanGenome","tagline":"Calculates overlap of multiple genomes and prepares files for CIRCOS visualization software","body":"### Welcome to the PanGenome Creator\r\n\r\n### The Prokaryotic Genome\r\nThe prokaryotic genome is one continuous strand of DNA, unlike ours, which is made of multiple chromosomes. Because it is circular, the prokaryotic genome is perfect for CIRCOS visualization software, which, for this program, shows the overlap of the genomes of many different species. \r\n\r\n### Genomic Comparision\r\nOne reason this is useful is for inter-species genomic comparision. If you have many similar species, it may be useful to pinpoint specific genes that are common to a group as well as isolate genes that are unique to a specific strand. In this way, you may be able to see how a specific gene contributes to that species' environment. \r\n\r\nTo see how CIRCOS visualization nicely compliments our program, click [here](http://i.imgur.com/ufQLmbf.png).\r\n\r\n### User Guide\r\nOn a Linux based system, you can call the program right into the command line. It has 2 required parameters, both of which are text files. The first describes your clusters of genes. The second is a text file with the names of your corresponding FASTA files on separate lines. Each fasta file must contain the name of your protein and the amino acid sequence in standard FASTA format.\r\n\r\nThe program can be called by:\r\n\r\n`[user@localhost] $ python pangenome.py groups.txt fasta_files.txt`\r\n\r\nAfter pangenome.py is run, you can generate your PanGenome via CIRCOS visualization:\r\n\r\n`[user@localhost] $ circos -conf config_file.conf`\r\n\r\nSimply update your .conf file with your files generated by pangenome.py.\r\n\r\n### Authors \r\nThis program was created by Evan Denmark (@edenmark) and Matthew Neave (@neavemj) at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Apprill Lab.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
